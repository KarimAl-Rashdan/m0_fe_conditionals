# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel very confident with the comparison operators.
3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
The logical oerators make sense. So far && and || are easy to follow.
5. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I am confident with the if statements. I wish there was a short hand way to make all of the conditions.
7. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent a lot of time on this topic. I want to say 5 hours. I don't think the conditional challenges themselves was hard. I think the forking, cloning, and then committing/adding all of the changes between atom and the terminal had me second guessing my progress a lot. I originally estimated this lesson to take me 2 hours. I think this lesson helped me understand Github a lot better through my struggles.
9. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I fully plan on spending any extra time i have navigating inside of Github and my terminal. I plan on setting some time before class to work on this so that I can come to class with specific questions to any problems I come across.
11. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I definitely want to go over pushing aand pulling repositories. I'm confused why when I cloned and pulled the m0_fe_conditionals repository all of the files didn't show up in my terminal. I thought that was the point of pulling a remote repository to my local machine. I fully intend to research these answers myself, and if i'm still confused I'll bring specific questions to the next live class.
